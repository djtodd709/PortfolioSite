          <p style="font-size: 1em;">
              After creating a mechanic for meerkats to dig tunnels in an earlier release, the team wanted to
              expand on the concept of animals going underground. This was realised in the form of burrows, a
              place for certain animals to rest, give birth, and hide from adverse weather. Here's some of the
              details of my implementation.

        <h3>Modifying Behaviour</h3>
        <p>
            Our animals have a wide variety of behaviours that they can choose to perform. Which behaviour is chosen
            depends on the animal's needs at the time, for example every animal has a Hunger need which becomes more
            important until they eat. However when inside a burrow, some of these needs could not be fulfilled, and
            other needs required very different behaviours to their overground equivalents.
        </p>
        <div class="row center">
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 portfolio-item">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="BurrowBehaviours.gif" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            To solve this, I created a new system of burrow behaviours, that could reuse the useful elements of
            overground behaviours, while also allowing us to tweak them for underground use as the design developed.
            This gave us a whole host of new behaviours while diminishing the concern about bugs, as these were based
            on behaviours already thoroughly QA tested.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Animal Movement</h3>
        <p>
            When planning out the burrows, I spoke with our modelling team about including a preset navigation mesh
            in the burrow interior. We'd previously done this with staff buildings, and thanks to my code we got this
            working for animals too, meaning navigation was handled by pre-existing, tested solutions.
        </p>
        <div class="row center">
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 portfolio-item">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="BurrowExit.gif" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            I also specified that the burrow entrance should have no floor geometry. This enabled me to reuse the walk
            animations for each animal, to stitch together an entrance/exit animation in code. This saved hours of
            animation time creating bespoke entrances/exits that would have been needed otherwise. Combined with the
            navigation inside the burrow, this made adding burrowing to pre-existing animals require no new animation
            work, while still looking great.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Feature Polish</h3>
        <p>
            As the burrows were underground in an area not normally accessible by players, I worked on our camera code
            to allow players to see into their burrows via an in-universe webcam, which they could also cast onto
            billboards they placed throughout their park. The camera was in a fixed location, so it didn't take long
            to rustle up a burrow-exclusive camera investigation behavior, re-using existing animations.
        </p>
        <div class="row center">
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 portfolio-item">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="BurrowCamera.gif" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            I also developed a queue system, so animals entering/exiting clipped with each other as little as possible,
            as well as a claim system so that pregnant mothers could enter the burrow, and avoid having other animals
            disrupt the new family. These were all stretch goals that were met thanks to my planning and code/asset
            re-use, and we managed to investigate and implement (where appropriate) all elements of the original design.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What I'd do next time</h3>
        <p>
            Considering how the final product turned out, I see a lot of potential in a system that was more generalised.
            I planned out an "underground area animals can go to sleep/shelter/give birth" when I could've planned a
            "____ area animals can go to ____", something more extendable for the future. We haven't needed a similar
            system since, but a more generic system always makes it easier for designers to suggest ways to use it.
