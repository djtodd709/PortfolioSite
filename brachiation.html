              With the addition of Siamangs to Planet Zoo, the team felt it was important that swinging from beams
              was included in some form, a trademark gibbon behaviour. My main goal was creating a system that gave
              animation the ability to create impressive swinging motions, while ensuring players could build a wide
              variety of frame layouts. Here's how I did it.

        <h3>Key Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Animation programming</li>
            <li>Inter-departmental communication</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Climbing system integration</h3>
        <p>
            Planet Zoo does have a climbing system, where smaller pieces can be placed together into larger climbing frames.
            However, it was decided that this system had too many unknowns when considering if/how animals could hang below
            beams and traverse between them. There was also a desire from animation to make the brachiation movement more
            dynamic, something that couldn't be done if it was done in the same way as climbing.
        </p>
        <div class="row center">
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 portfolio-item">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="BrachiationSwing.gif" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            My solution was to make the brachiation frame, an enrichment item that was accessed by climbing. Animal enrichments
            have much more bespoke animations due to their larger size, alongside more restrictions on where/how they can be
            placed. This helped us know exactly where Siamangs would be when swinging on the frame, so we could make it look
            just right. Integrating it with the climbing system also made it usable by other climbing animals, getting us more
            value from the asset.
        </p>

        <h3>Modular frame pieces</h3>
        <p>
            Originally the frame was a large singular piece, but as this would restrict player freedom I pushed for a more modular
            mechanic, where the player could place and connect various pieces to form their own layouts. This required me to create
            a new version of our scenery snapping system, letting the asset creation team put specific snapping points on scenery pieces
            so that players can easily put pieces together in an expected way.
        </p>
        <div class="row center">
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 portfolio-item">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="BrachiationSnap.gif" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12 portfolio-item"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Another advantage of modular pieces was that animation lengths could be reduced while still giving time for impressive
            motions. I worked with Art, Design, Animation and Production to oversee how each element of the feature came together,
            leading weekly update meetings to ensure each department was coordinated, and highlight any issues that could hinder
            other departments once assets got to them.<br>With this level of planning we were able to produce more animations than
            expected, giving Siamangs one set of standard traversal animations, and 5 different acrobatic animations that could be
            interchanged with the standard ones during traversal. This meant Siamangs very rarely used beams in exactly the same way.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Frame transitions</h3>
        <p>
            One of the positives of modular pieces was that Siamangs could start their animations at multiple points on the frame.
            However, this meant it was important that the animals should be able to transition between pieces during the swinging
            animation.<br>To achieve this, I asked animation to create a short on-the-spot loop of the Siamang brachiation. Once an
            animal finished swinging on it's current frame, it would check if another frame was connected in front of it. If so,
            the motion of the Siamang was taken over by my code, which moved it to the start point of it's next animation. This allowed
            not only for frame transitions, but transitions between frames that weren't exactly aligned, something that couldn't be guaranteed.
        </p>

        <h3>What I'd do next time</h3>
        <p>
            Given unlimited time, I would have loved to experiment with some form of hand IK, allowing siamangs to grip the pole
            reliably, and allowing animations to be made a lot faster. This would allow for more varieties of beam to be
            created, as animation time was the limiting factor for this feature.<br>For a more practical change, it would have been
            useful to discuss the beam dimensions at an earlier stage to ensure they all synergize (e.g. having two quarter turn pieces cover 
            the same distance as one half turn piece).
