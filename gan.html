            Generative Adversarial Network Game
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>TensorFlow</li>
            <li>Unity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This was an individual project. After reading a paper on how a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09154">Generative Adversarial Network was used to generate DOOM levels</a>, I wanted to see
            if a similar type of machine learning based generation could be applied to other forms of game content. I designed and created a strategy game, featuring attacks that could not easilly be created by
            conventional procedural generation without being imbalanced. Creating two neural networks in TensorFlow, a 'generator' and a 'discriminator', I was able to train the network to a point where very few
            imbalanced attacks were generated.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also created a strategy game in Unity, to show that the generated content could be used in a game without breaking the established game balance.
            The game read in a csv file containing the results of the generation, and playtesting revealed that players thought the generated playthroughs were just as good as playthroughs using the training set of attacks.
            Gameplay footage can be seen in the video below.

        <h4>What I'd do next time</h4>
        <p>
            I would have liked to include the generation process within the game itself, so that truly infinite ammounts of content could have been created.
            In terms of further extensions, I think it would be cool to have the network see which attacks get chosen more often, and adapt to generate more similar types of attack.
