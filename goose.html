                I'd previously created a basic game engine in C++, and made <i>Unoriginal Goose Game</i>, a blatant rip-off
                that helped me develop the engine further (e.g. adding physics/UI/AI systems). Here's the details of my online
                system, alongside some of the other features of the program.

            The goal of the game was simple, collect the most apples and return them to your base. One player would start a server and would wait for another player
            to enter as a client (The game by default simply looked for a server on the local network, but this was modifiable). In terms of what was sent between
            players, the majority of game logic was handled client side, and the only regularly sent data from the client was the position of their player, alongside
            any other inputs. To ensure the consistency of the world, transforms and data of objects would ocassionally be synced from the server, with the client
            attempting to only update each object is it wasn't being interacted with, and ideally if it was out of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here you can see a demonstration of a game starting, the consistent world, alongside other features of the engine. A* pathfinding was implemented alongside
            a state based AI system for the enemy humans, and objects like the football demonstate Sphere-Sphere and Sphere-AABB collisions (OBB collisions and physics
            constraints were also present in other parts of the game).

        <h4>What I'd do next time</h4>
        <p>
            There's a lot of small reliability improvements to be made here, but here's one example. As can be seen in the video when the football is kicked, the rotation of each
            object wasn't reliably consistent between clients. This was mainly as issue as there was no rotation at all, so sending updates after specific events would
            have been a good improvement. Colliding with the footbal triggered an impulse force on the ball, and at the same time a message could have been sent out ensuring the ball would spin.
